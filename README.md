# 80_PA SecuROM keygen
**SecuROM** (Sony DADC AG SecuROM) - most famous DRM, which protect the world famous AAA games:
* Grand Theft Auto IV  
* Bioshock  
* Spore  
* Batman: Arkham City
* Arcania: Gothic 4
* Final Fantasy VII
* Sam & Max
* Mass Effect
* Wolfenstein (2009)
* Tale of Wuxia: Prequel
* Dead Space
* Pro Evolution Soccer
* Ys Foliage Ocean in Celceta
* The Sims 3
* CellFactor: Psychokinetic Wars
* Cody Pops the Case
* TRON: Evolution
and lot of others.

In 2019, all of legal users the *TRON: Evolution* encountered a problem activating the game, due to the fact that Sony has disabled the activation servers. 

To solve problems with SecuROM Product activation (SecuROM PA) starting from 2014 there is 80_PA SecuROM keygen, which does not require a serial number (s/n) and is a professional tool for working with SecuROM PA activation (Request Unlock code, Unlock code, HWID decoder & generator).

This is the result of the 386 Team's successful and true painstaking work against SecuROM DRM (and DENUVO as well, of course) - all the Sony DADC AG protection algorithms have been cracked and reversed. 

***Reinhard Blaukovitsch*** (SecuROM's lead developer and founder of DENUVO GmbH) has known about the existence of 80_PA from the beginning, but he has no desire to admit his defeat to the pirates.

The last version of SecuROM 8.13 was released in 2014 after DENUVO publish, and protected games from Heluo Studio. It is the only and unsuccessful attempt by SONY DADC AG to counter 80_PA, when changes were made to hide the operation of the RSA algorithm and DES keys.
